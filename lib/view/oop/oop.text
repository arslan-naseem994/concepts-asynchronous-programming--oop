Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
is a way of writing computer programs 
using the idea of "objects" to represent data and methods. Imagine you 
have a toy box. Each toy in the box can be thought of as an "object"; 
they each have their own features (like data) and things they can do 
(like methods).


Here's a simple explanation of the four main OOP concepts:


Encapsulation: 
This is like each toy having a box of its own. You can't 
change or even see the toy's parts directly; you can only play with it 
using the buttons and levers on the box. In programming, this means keeping
the inner workings private and only exposing what's necessary for others
to interact with it.


Inheritance: 
Suppose you have a basic toy car. Now, you want to make a 
fire truck toy. Instead of creating a new toy from scratch, you take the
toy car and add new features to it, like a ladder and a siren. Inheritance
lets you create a new class (fire truck) based on an existing class 
(toy car), inheriting its features and adding new ones.

Polymorphism: 
This is like having a control that can play with any toy. 
Whether it's a toy car, a toy plane, or a toy boat, you use the same 
control, but it makes each toy do different things. In programming, 
polymorphism lets you use a single interface to control different types 
of objects, and each object responds in its own way.

Abstraction: 
This is like knowing that you can play with a toy by pressing 
buttons without knowing how the toy works inside. You don't need to know 
the mechanics of how the toy car moves; you just need to know what buttons 
to press. Abstraction in programming means creating simple models of 
complex things by highlighting what an object can do and hiding how 
it does it.


In Flutter, 
these concepts are used all the time with widgets. Each widget is like 
an object: it has its own properties (data) and methods 
(functions it can perform). When you create a new widget by extending 
another one, you're using inheritance. When you override a widget's 
method, that's polymorphism. And the way you interact with widgets 
without needing to know their internal workings is abstraction.
